Assignment - Internship Project

This project demonstrates my skills in Next.js and web development. It involves creating a full-stack application with a frontend interface and backend logic handled via Next.js API routes.
Features

    Multi step form: Allows users to enter valid input value and validate it using zod.
    Backend Integration: Utilizes Next.js API routes to handle form data so that it presist during page reloading and state change.
    Responsive Design: The site works seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices.
    Theme Toggle: Set darkmode and light mode base on user preferences.

Technologies Used

    Frontend:
        Next.js, React
        Tailwind CSS , shadcn ui (component library), framer motion, Context api. 
    Backend:
        Next.js API Routes
    Deployment:
        Vercel for hosting the live demo
